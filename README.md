# TCE NSS Photo Booth

Our team has developed an Photo Booth Web Application designed to capture and share selfies effortlessly. Users can take photos directly through the web interface, which are then instantly sent to socail platforms. The application provides a simple, user-friendly interface and ensures quick image delivery, making it perfect when you smile...

**Note: This is a part of Fork'n Roll Challenge 2024 (Coders Club TCE)**
